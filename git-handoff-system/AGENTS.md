# Agent Defaults

Use the least context, planning, and validation that can complete the task reliably.

## Work

- Start with the request and relevant files. Before editing, run `git status --short --branch`; inspect broader Git state only when needed and preserve unrelated changes.
- Do not formally plan clear, localized work, including routine Android Studio prompts. Plan only when requested or when work is ambiguous, high-risk, multi-phase, dependency-ordered, cross-system, or multi-session. Reuse plans; update them only when the approach changes materially.

## Context

- Before loading unknown or potentially large files, batch-run `python scripts/context_probe.py scan <paths>`. Apply individual and `TOTAL` risk: **low** may be read fully; **medium** search/chunk first; **high** needs a task-specific reason for a full read; **extreme** needs user confirmation unless exhaustive review was requested or is essential to an authorized high-risk operation.
- For append-only logs, histories, and reports, search known terms first; otherwise use `context_probe.py tail`, then `chunk` backward only as needed. Preserve order within chunks. For source, configuration, manifests, and structurally ordered documents, use symbols/search/line ranges—never tail-first reading.
- Ask before optional repository-wide inspection, exhaustive logs/history/research, or other major context expansion. State why it helps and the bounded alternative.

## Verification

- Run the smallest relevant check. Broaden only for failure, unclear impact, shared interfaces, dependencies/build configuration, schemas/migrations, security/authentication, concurrency, persistence, PRs, or releases.
- For noisy commands use `python scripts/compact_check.py --name <label> -- <command>`; use `--quiet` for silent success. Never claim an unrun check passed or rerun a successful check after no relevant change.
- Allow at most two diagnose/fix/retest cycles for the same failure; then summarize and ask before expanding unless broader validation was requested. Prefer configured CI for full matrices and inspect failed steps first.

## Handoffs

- Read the active handoff only when resuming/inheriting work or scope is unclear; read only needed, newest history. Consult relevant sections of `MASTER_HANDOFF.md` for lifecycle/recovery, `REPOSITORY.md` for policy/check profiles, and `MULTI_AGENT.md` only for actual concurrency. Concurrent agents require separate worktrees.
- Update a handoff once only when durable objective, scope, decisions, blockers, risks, meaningful validation, or next action changed—not for read-only, routine, no-op, or context-neutral work. Update the index only for branch inventory/role/order; append history only for milestones.
- Run `python scripts/validate_handoffs.py --quiet` after structural handoff changes and when configured for PRs. Follow `MASTER_HANDOFF.md` for destructive/branch-closing operations; never delete branch documentation.
